/**
 * The contract between the sync engine (src/device-sync/engine, which owns all
 * I/O: provider queries and batches, JMAP requests, retries, state) and the
 * two mappers (src/device-sync/contacts and src/device-sync/calendar, which
 * are pure planners). docs/device-sync.md describes the rules both follow.
 *
 * A planner never performs I/O. The engine queries rows with the planner's
 * column lists, hands them to `decode*`, asks for a plan, and applies the
 * plan's op groups. Every op group is applied atomically; asserts come first
 * in a group, so a group whose rows changed since they were read fails as a
 * whole and the engine re-reads and re-plans that item.
 *
 * `refs` inside a group's ops are indexes into THAT group; the engine rebases
 * them when it packs several groups into one batch, and marks the first op of
 * each group `yieldAllowed`.
